"Fully numerical electronic structure calculations on diatomic
molecules in weak to strong magnetic fields"

by Susi Lehtola, Maria Dimitrova, and Dage Sundholm

arXiv:1812.06274


The files contain the unrestricted Hartree-Fock energies within the
fully numerical basis sets, employing three 15-node radial Lobatto
elements, and various angular basis sets ranging from 15,11,7 to
31,27,23 for the cutoffs in l_\sigma, l_\pi, and l_\delta,
respectively.

The columns are as follows:
1:     B field, atomic units
2-3:   H2   singlet and triplet
4-5:   HeH+ singlet and triplet
6-8:   LiH, singlet, triplet, and quintet
9-11:  BeH+ singlet, triplet, and quintet
12-14: BH   singlet, triplet, and quintet
15-17: CH+  singlet, triplet, and quintet
