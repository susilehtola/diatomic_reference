"Fully numerical electronic structure calculations on diatomic
molecules in weak to strong magnetic fields"

by Susi Lehtola, Maria Dimitrova, and Dage Sundholm

arXiv:1812.06274


The files contain the unrestricted Hartree-Fock energies within the
fully numerical basis sets, employing three 15-node radial Lobatto
elements, and various angular basis sets ranging from 15,11,7 to
31,27,23 for the cutoffs in l_\sigma, l_\pi, and l_\delta,
respectively.
